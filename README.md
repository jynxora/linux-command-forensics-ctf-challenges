# 🔐 Linux Command Flag Challenge — CTF-Lite

This mini-CTF was designed to test and improve practical Linux command-line skills through hidden flags, suspicious file permissions, and forensic-style searches. 
All tasks are set within a simulated directory structure with varying permissions, ownerships, and file types.

## 🧩 Challenge Covers:
- Locate world-writable files and explain their risk
- Identify SUID-enabled binaries owned by root
- Detect files not owned by the current user
- Find files with no read/write/execute permissions
- Recursively extract hidden flags inside `.txt` files
